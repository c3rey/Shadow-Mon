__SHADOW-MON__

Welcome to Shadow-Mon! This is a 2d pixel adventure game coded entirely in Java, and it's my first project! 
I began the project using this tutorial: [How to Make a 2D Game in Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow). 
After I learned hot to create the effect of character collision (very early on in the project, with under 10 files), I decided to ditch the tutorial completely and figure the rest out. 
Because of this, parts of the project made earlier on in the lifespan of the project may have slightly different programming ideologies from my own, but by the time you're reading this, the majority of those discrepancies will have been ironed out.
In short, I hope to keep the classes (GameObject and Door, or ObjectManager and DoorManager) as similarly designed as possible.

Enjoy!
